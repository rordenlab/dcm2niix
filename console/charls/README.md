# CharLS

CharLS is a C++ implementation of the JPEG-LS standard for lossless and near-lossless image compression and decompression.
JPEG-LS is a low-complexity image compression standard that matches JPEG 2000 compression ratios.

# CharLS and dcm2niix

[CharLS](https://github.com/team-charls/charls) is an optional module for dcm2niix. If included, it allows dcm2niix to handle the [JPEG-LS transfer syntaxes](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage#DICOM_Transfer_Syntaxes_and_Compressed_Images). The included code was downloaded from the CharLS website on 6 June 2018.

It is worth noting that DICOM can specify three different [lossless forms of the JPEG](http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/crnl/tools/jpeg-formats) image standard. CharLS is used only for the JPEG-LS form (transfer syntaxes 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80/81; ISO/IEC 14495-1:1999 ITU-T.87). In contrast, dcm2niix uses bespoke code to handle the older JPEG-Lossless (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.57/70; ISO/IEC 10918-1:1994 ITU-T.81). Finally, dcm2niix handles the very complex JPEG-2000 lossless (1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90/91; ISO/IEC 15444-1:2004 ITU-T.800) using the [OpenJPEG](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg) library.

To enable support you will need to include the `myEnableJPEGLS` compiler flag as well as a few file sin the `charls` folder. You will also need to specify `-std=c++14` and use a compiler that supports c++14 or later. Therefore, a minimal compile should look like this:

`g++ -I. -std=c++14 -DmyEnableJPEGLS charls/jpegls.cpp charls/jpegmarkersegment.cpp charls/interface.cpp  charls/jpegstreamwriter.cpp charls/jpegstreamreader.cpp main_console.cpp nii_foreign.cpp nii_dicom.cpp jpg_0XC3.cpp ujpeg.cpp nifti1_io_core.cpp nii_ortho.cpp nii_dicom_batch.cpp  -o dcm2niix -DmyDisableOpenJPEG`

The option `myEnableJPEGLS` specifies the latest version of CharLS (currently version 2). Alternatively, you can specify `myEnableJPEGLS1` to compile for  CharLS version 1. This older code is not included with dcm2niix, but you can  [download it from Github](https://github.com/team-charls/charls/tree/1.x-master). Note that CharLS version 1 is designed for c++03:

`g++ -I. -std=c++03 -DmyEnableJPEGLS1  charls1/header.cpp charls1/jpegls.cpp charls1/jpegmarkersegment.cpp charls1/interface.cpp  charls1/jpegstreamwriter.cpp main_console.cpp nii_foreign.cpp nii_dicom.cpp jpg_0XC3.cpp ujpeg.cpp nifti1_io_core.cpp nii_ortho.cpp nii_dicom_batch.cpp  -o dcm2niix -DmyDisableOpenJPEG`

Note that in these examples we have disabled OpenJPEG's JPEG2000 support. In reality, you will probably want to support both JPEG2000 and JPEG-LS, this will allow you to convert a broader range of images, and JPEG2000 includes lossy variations that do not have analogues for JPEG-LS. For details on adding the JPEG2000 module see this  [compile page](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/blob/master/COMPILE.md).

# JPEG-LS versus other lossless JPEG codecs

You can use gdcmconv to compare the performance of the ancient JPEG-lossless (gdcmconv -J; default mode for dcmcjpeg), JPEG-LS (gdcmconv -L) and JPEG2000-lossess (gdcmconv -K). Below is a sample test looking at 800 DICOM CT scans - with a raw size of 425mb which dcm2niix can convert in 1.6 seconds. The table shows that JPEG-LS reduces the file sizes to 137mb (0.39 original size), but that decompression takes 7.2 times longer. In contrast, the complicated JPEG2000 achieves only slightly better compression but is much slower to decompress.

| CT                                        | Size  | Speed |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----:| -----:|
| Raw 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1                   |  1.00 |  1.0  |
| JPEG-lossless 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70      |  0.37 |  6.4  |
| JPEG-LS 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80            |  0.32 |  7.2  |
| JPEG2000 lossless 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90  |  0.31 | 60.1  |

Below is a sample test looking at 1092 DICOM MRI scans with a Siemens Prisma with 16-bit output (many older systems use 12-bit output which would presumably provide more compression potential) - with a raw size of 425mb which dcm2niix can convert in 4.7 seconds. Note that the MRI scans show poorer compression for all techniques.

| MRI                                       | Size  | Speed |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----:| -----:|
| Raw 1.2.840.10008.1.2.1                   |  1.00 |  1.0  |
| JPEG-lossless 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.70      |  0.65 |  5.0  |
| JPEG-LS 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.80            |  0.60 |  7.7  |
| JPEG2000 lossless 1.2.840.10008.1.2.4.90  |  0.61 | 71.6  |

The tables above describe illustrate the speed for decompression. With respect to compression, the MRI images take 54 seconds to compress as JPEG-lossless, 72 seconds to compress as JPEG-LS and 212 seconds for JPEG2000 lossless. These tests support the notion that JPEG-LS provides similar compression to JPEG2000 lossless with much faster compression and decompression. In fairness, it should be noted that all these tests use open source OpenJPEG library for JPEG2000 compression and decompression. This library is known to be robust but [slow compared to proprietary libraries](https://blog.hexagongeospatial.com/jpeg2000-quirks/).

## About JPEG-LS

JPEG-LS (ISO/IEC 14495-1:1999 / ITU-T.87) is an image compression standard derived from the Hewlett Packard LOCO algorithm. JPEG-LS has low complexity (meaning fast compression) and high compression ratios, similar to the JPEG 2000 lossless ratios. JPEG-LS is more similar to the old Lossless JPEG than to JPEG 2000, but interestingly the two different techniques result in vastly different performance characteristics.
Wikipedia on lossless JPEG and JPEG-LS: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lossless_JPEG>
Tip: the ITU makes their version of the JPEG-LS standard (ITU-T.87) freely available for download, the text is identical with the ISO version.

## About this software

This project's goal is to provide a full implementation of the ISO/IEC 14495-1:1999, "Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images: Baseline" standard. This library is written from scratch in portable C++. The master branch uses modern C++14. The 1.x branch is maintained in C++03. All mainstream JPEG-LS features are implemented by this library.
According to preliminary test results published on http://imagecompression.info/gralic, CharLS is about *twice as fast* as the original HP code, and beats both JPEG-XR and JPEG 2000 by a factor 3.

### Limitations

* No support for (optional) JPEG restart markers (RST). These markers are rarely used in practice.
* No support for the SPIFF file header.
* No support for oversize image dimension. Maximum supported image dimensions are [1, 65535] by [1, 65535].
* After releasing the original baseline standrd 14495-1:1999, ISO released an extension to the JPEG-LS standard called ISO/IEC 14495-2:2003: "Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images: Extensions". CharLS doesn't support these extensions.

## Supported platforms

The code is regularly compiled/tested on Windows and 64 bit Linux. Additionally, the code has been successfully tested on Linux Intel/AMD 32/64 bit (slackware, debian, gentoo), Solaris SPARC systems, Intel based Macs and Windows CE (ARM CPU, emulated), where the less common compilers may require minor code edits. It leverages C++ language features (templates, traits) to create optimized code, which generally perform best with recent compilers. If you compile with GCC, 64 bit code performs substantially better.

## Users & Acknowledgements

CharLS is being used by [GDCM DICOM toolkit](http://sourceforge.net/projects/gdcm/), thanks for [Mathieu Malaterre](http://sourceforge.net/users/malat) for getting CharLS started on Linux. [Kato Kanryu](http://knivez.homelinux.org/) wrote an initial version of the color transforms and the DIB output format code, for an [irfanview](http://www.irfanview.com) plugin using CharLS. Thanks to Uli Schlachter, CharLS now finally runs correctly on big-endian architectures like Sun SPARC.
