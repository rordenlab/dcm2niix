## About

dcm2niix is designed to convert neuroimaging data from the DICOM format to the NIfTI format. This web page hosts the developmental source code - a compiled version for Linux, MacOS, and Windows of the most recent stable release is included with [MRIcroGL](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/). A full manual for this software is available in the form of a [NITRC wiki](http://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage).

## License

This software is open source. The bulk of the code is covered by the BSD license. Some units are either public domain (nifti*.*, miniz.c) or use the MIT license (ujpeg.cpp). See the license.txt file for more details.

## Dependencies

This software should run on macOS, Linux and Windows typically without requiring any other software. However, if you use dcm2niix to create gz-compressed images it will be faster if you have [pigz](https://github.com/madler/pigz) installed. You can get a version of both dcm2niix and pigz compiled for your operating system by downloading [MRIcroGL](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/).

## Image Conversion and Compression

DICOM provides many ways to store/compress image data, known as [transfer syntaxes](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage#DICOM_Transfer_Syntaxes_and_Compressed_Images). The [COMPILE.md file describes details](./COMPILE.md) on how to enable different options to provide support for more formats.

 - The base code includes support for raw, run-length encoded, and classic JPEG lossless decoding.
 - Lossy JPEG is handled by the included [NanoJPEG](https://keyj.emphy.de/nanojpeg/). This support is modular: you can compile for [libjpeg-turbo](https://github.com/chris-allan/libjpeg-turbo) or disable it altogether.
 - JPEG-LS lossless support is optional, and can be provided by using [CharLS](https://github.com/team-charls/charls).
  - JPEG2000 lossy and lossless support is optional, and can be provided using [OpenJPEG](https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg) or [Jasper](https://www.ece.uvic.ca/~frodo/jasper/).
 - GZ compression (e.g. creating .nii.gz images) is optional, and can be provided using either the included [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) or the popular zlib. Of particular note, the [Cloudflare zlib](https://github.com/cloudflare/zlib) exploits modern hardware (available since 2008) for very rapid compression. Alternatively, you can compile dcm2niix without a gzip compressor. Regardless of how you compile dcm2niix, it can use the external program [pigz](https://github.com/madler/pigz) for parallel compression.

## Versions

[See releases](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases) for recent release notes. [See the VERSIONS.md file for details on earlier releases](./VERSIONS.md).

## Running

Command line usage is described in the [NITRC wiki](https://www.nitrc.org/plugins/mwiki/index.php/dcm2nii:MainPage#General_Usage). The minimal command line call would be `dcm2niix /path/to/dicom/folder`. However, you may want to invoke additional options, for example the call `dcm2niix -z y -f %p_%t_%s -o /path/ouput /path/to/dicom/folder` will save data as gzip compressed, with the filename based on the protocol name (%p) acquisition time (%t) and DICOM series number (%s), with all files saved to the folder "output". For more help see help: `dcm2niix -h`.

[See the BATCH.md file for instructions on using the batch processing version](./BATCH.md).

## Install

There are a couple ways to install dcm2niix
 - [Github Releases](https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases) provides the latest compiled executables. This is an excellent option for MacOS and Windows users. However, the provided Linux executable requires a recent version of Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 14.04 or later), so the provided Unix executable is not suitable for very old distributions. Specifically, it requires Glibc 2.19 (from 2014) or later. Users of older systems can compile their own copy of dcm2niix or download the compiled version included with MRIcroGL Glibc 2.12 (from 2011, see below).
 - Run the following command to get the latest version for Linux, Macintosh or Windows: 
   * `curl -fLO https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases/latest/download/dcm2niix_lnx.zip`
   * `curl -fLO https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases/latest/download/dcm2niix_mac.zip`
   * `curl -fLO https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix/releases/latest/download/dcm2niix_win.zip`
 - [MRIcroGL (NITRC)](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl) or [MRIcroGL (GitHub)](https://github.com/rordenlab/MRIcroGL12/releases) includes dcm2niix that can be run from the command line or from the graphical user interface (select the Import menu item). The Linux version of dcm2niix is compiled on a [holy build box](https://github.com/phusion/holy-build-box), so it should run on any Linux distribution.
 - If you have a MacOS computer with Homebrew you can run `brew install dcm2niix`.
 - If you have Conda, [`conda install -c conda-forge dcm2niix`](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/dcm2niix) on Linux, MacOS or Windows.
 - On Debian Linux computers you can run `sudo apt-get install dcm2niix`.


## Build from source

It is often easier to download and install a precompiled version. However, you can also build from source.

### Build command line version with cmake (Linux, MacOS, Windows)

`cmake` and `pkg-config` (optional) can be installed as follows:

Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake pkg-config`

MacOS: `brew install cmake pkg-config`

**Basic build:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix.git
cd dcm2niix
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```
`dcm2niix` will be created in the `bin` subfolder. To install on the system run `make install` instead of `make` - this will copy the executable to your path so you do not have to provide the full path to the executable.

In rare case if cmake fails with the message like `"Generator: execution of make failed"`, it could be fixed by ``sudo ln -s `which make` /usr/bin/gmake``.

**Advanced build:**

As noted in the `Image Conversion and Compression Support` section, the software provides many optional modules with enhanced features. A common choice might be to include support for JPEG2000, [JPEG-LS](https://github.com/team-charls/charls) (this option requires a  c++14 compiler), as well as using the high performance Cloudflare zlib library (this option requires a CPU built after 2008). To build with these options simply request them when configuring cmake:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rordenlab/dcm2niix.git
cd dcm2niix
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DZLIB_IMPLEMENTATION=Cloudflare -DUSE_JPEGLS=ON -DUSE_OPENJPEG=ON ..
make
```

**optional batch processing version:**

The batch processing binary `dcm2niibatch` is optional. To build `dcm2niibatch` as well change the cmake command to `cmake -DBATCH_VERSION=ON ..`. This requires a compiler that supports c++11.

### Building the command line version without cmake

If you have any problems with the cmake build script described above or want to customize the software see the [COMPILE.md file for details on manual compilation](./COMPILE.md).
